    "# 🛢️ **Introduction to MySQL**\n",
    "\n",
    "**MySQL** is a popular **open-source relational database management system (RDBMS)** used for managing structured data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **Why Use MySQL?**\n",
    "- Fast and reliable for handling large datasets.\n",
    "- Supports **Structured Query Language (SQL)** for database operations.\n",
    "- Scalable and widely used in web applications.\n",
    "- Provides security, indexing, and transaction support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **Key Concepts in MySQL**\n",
    "### 1️⃣ **Databases & Tables**  \n",
    "   - A **database** is a structured collection of data.  \n",
    "   - A **table** is a collection of related data stored in rows and columns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ **SQL (Structured Query Language)**  \n",
    "   - **DDL (Data Definition Language)** → `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`  \n",
    "   - **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** → `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`  \n",
    "   - **DQL (Data Query Language)** → `SELECT` (for retrieving data)  \n",
    "   - **DCL (Data Control Language)** → `GRANT`, `REVOKE` (for user permissions)  \n",
    "   - **TCL (Transaction Control Language)** → `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ **Relationships in MySQL**  \n",
    "   - **One-to-One** → A user has one profile.  \n",
    "   - **One-to-Many** → A customer can have multiple orders.  \n",
    "   - **Many-to-Many** → Students enrolled in multiple courses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ **Indexes & Constraints**  \n",
    "   - **Indexes** improve query performance.  \n",
    "   - **Constraints** like `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, and `NOT NULL` ensure data integrity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **Final Thoughts**  \n",
    "MySQL is a **powerful and efficient** database system for managing structured data.  \n",
    "✨ *Let’s explore MySQL with practical queries!* 🚀  \n"
